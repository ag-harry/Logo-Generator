## Logo Generator Application

Description

Logo Generator is a Node.js application that allows users to generate SVG logos interactively. The user is prompted to choose several design elements including the logo shape, color, text, text color, font, and size. Three shapes are supported: circle, square, and triangle. Each logo generated is unique and personalized based on the user's inputs.

Logos generated by this application can be used for branding purposes, as profile pictures, or for any other use where a simple and customized logo is required.

## How the Application Works
Upon starting the application, the user is presented with a series of prompts:

Enter the text for the logo.
Choose a color for the text.
Choose a size for the text.
Choose a style for the text.
Choose a font for the text.
Choose a shape for the logo.
Choose a color for the shape.

Based on the user's input, the application generates an SVG logo that fits the user's specifications. The SVG file is saved in the /examples directory as logo.svg. A PNG version of the logo is also generated and saved as logo.png.
